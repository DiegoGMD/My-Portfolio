            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm Diego Gil Molés, a student pursuing a "Técnico Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones
                Multiplataforma" course at IES El Caminàs, aspiring to become a skilled programmer. My passion for
                coding drives me to explore, design, develop, and manage various types of applications, including
                multimedia apps, mobile apps, and enterprise solutions.</p>
            <p>Throughout this course, I have gained knowledge in key programming languages, frameworks, database
                management, development environments, and interface design. I particularly enjoy coding in Java and
                creating interactive applications, and I find completing coding projects highly gratifying. I have also
                explored advanced topics like implementing ERP and CRM systems, multimedia programming, and deploying
                applications across multiple platforms.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I hold a C1 Advanced Certificate in English from Cambridge
                University. In coding, I have intermediate proficiency in Java and am also skilled in HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and SQL.</p>
